        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <div class="content">
    <p><strong>Worked on traits of drosophila</strong></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to work on experiments involving quantitative traits, polytene chromosomes, and genetic crosses in Drosophila melanogaster. As part of this experience, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. Bodhisatta Nandy and Dr. Vineesh Shenoy, which provided me with an enriching opportunity to gain deeper insights into the Drosophila model system. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of genetics and developmental biology, offering a hands-on approach to exploring key concepts in the field.</p>
        <p><strong>Worked on experiments including cell culture basics</strong></p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to work on experiments related to cell culture fundamentals, including techniques such as the MTT assay and immunofluorescence assay, under the guidance of Dr. Selvi Bhrathavikru and Dr. Swati Shree Padhi. This experience provided me with valuable hands-on exposure to essential cell culture methodologies. Additionally, I had the opportunity to visualize and study different cell lines, such as M15 and MDMB, as part of my third-year coursework, further enhancing my practical understanding of cellular biology.</p>
            <p><strong>Worked on DLS and SEC based experiments</strong></p>
            <p>I had the extraordinary opportunity to deepen my understanding of Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), which provided me with valuable insights into these analytical techniques. Additionally, I had the privilege of learning from Dr. Shanthi Swaroop Srivastava as part of our lab course, which further enriched my knowledge and practical experience in the field.</p> 
            <p><strong>Worked on experiments based on Cancer and Inflammation(May-July 2024)</strong></p>
            <p>I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. Mirza S. Baig at IIT Indore on the topic of macrophage activation in cancer and inflammation. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the role of macrophages in disease progression and significantly enhanced my understanding of their functions. Furthermore, it offered me the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with a wide range of fundamental biological techniques, strengthening my practical skills in the laboratory.</p>

        <h2>Workshops/Conferences</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Summer webinar Series by LA VIDA (Biology club of IISER BPR)</strong></p>
            <p>Participating in this webinar series was a pivotal moment in my scientific journey. It provided me with a comprehensive crash course on several critical topics, including cancer vaccines and the challenges associated with their design and development, left-right patterning in mammalian embryos, and the formation and maintenance of muscles in living systems. This experience significantly broadened my understanding of these complex biological processes and their implications in health and disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Seminar conducted by DOB of IISER BPR</strong></p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to attend a talk by Dr. Nitin Singhal on Nano Therapeutics and the reduction of PCK-1 gene expression as part of the CSDAB program. This insightful session deepened my appreciation for the intricacies of biological sciences and provided me with a broader perspective on the potential of nanotechnology in therapeutic applications.</p>            
            <p><strong>Talk series </strong></p>
            <p>I attended a talk series that provided me with valuable insights into the self-incompatibility mechanisms in Alpinia mutica Roxb. This series also enhanced my understanding of fundamental concepts related to the role of RNA demethylase in regulating embryonic stem cell pluripotency. The knowledge gained from these sessions deepened my appreciation for the complexities of plant reproductive biology and stem cell regulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Engaged in a lab visit to Mondals lab at IISC banglore.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Attended a workshop at IIT bhubaneswar on Cancer biology.</strong></p>
            <p>I attended a workshop on Cancer Biology at IIT Bhubaneswar, where I gained valuable insights into advanced techniques such as gene therapy, immunotherapy, disease modeling, and next-generation diagnostics. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of cutting-edge approaches in cancer research and their potential applications in therapeutic development.</p>
