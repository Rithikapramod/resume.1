        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <div class="content">
    <p><strong>Worked on traits of drosophila</strong></p>
<p>I have worked on experiments including <b>Quantitative traits,polytene chromosome,cross between Drosophila melanogaster.</b>There I had an extraordinary opportunity to work under <b>Bodhisatta Nandy and Vineesh Shenoy</b>as a part of our course .I was fortunate to embark on enriching chance to know more about drosophila model system.</p>
        <p><strong>Worked on experiments including cell culture basics</strong></p>
            <p>I had an opportunity to work on experiments based upon cell culture basics like <b>MTT assay,Immunoflurescence Assay</b>instructed by<b>Dr Selvi Bhrathavikru and Dr Swati shree Padhi.</b>There I had a great opportunity to visualise different cell types like M15 and MDMB as a part of 3rd year course.</p>
            <p><strong>Worked on DLS and SEC based experiments</strong></p>
            <p>I had the extraordinary opportunity to know more about SEC and DLS.This helped me to know more about these concepts.Also had a great opportunity to learn from <b>Dr Shanthi Swaroop Srivastava</b> as a part of our lab course.</p>

            <p>Participating in this Webinar series was pivotal in my scientific journey.During this webinar,I recieved a comprehensie crash course on the topics like <b>Cancer vaccines,tere confronting challenges in Design and devolepment,left right patterning in mammalian embryos,Formation of muscles and their mintainance in the living system.</b> </p>
            <p><strong>Seminar conducted by DOB of IISER BPR</strong></p>
            <p>Engaged in the talk given by <b>Dr Nitin Singhal on Nano Therapeutics and reducing PCK-1 gene expression</b>as a part of CSDAB programme .This talk helped me a lot to indulge more into beauty of biological sciences. </p>            
            <p><strong>Talk series </strong></p>
            <p>Attended the talk series that gave me a lot of knowledge about <b>self incompatability mechanism in Alpinia mutica Roxb. plant</b> also it elped me to understand some basics about the role of<b>RNA demethylase on embryonic stem cell pluripotency</b>.</p>
            <p><strong>Engaged in a lab visit to mondels lab at IISC banglore.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Attended a workshop at IIT bhubaneswar on Cancer biology.</strong></p>
